A basic game build in c language that reply the fortnite videogame in a similar way. Is a 1vs1 game to play in local mode. It was a project for my university's course in Computer Science.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT AND FINAL BATTLE
At the beginning the players have to choose the difficulty's game. When the game start there is a simulation of the launch in the real fortnite and each player has to choose his side on the map for drop.
The game is based on turn, and in each turn the players can do different things.
In the game there is also the storm, like the real fortnite.
Finally in the final battle to make everything more playable I chose to add an additional feature for
try to kill and destroy the opponent's tower floors. The two players can then choose
to compete with Chinese morra and based on the result, the attack of each player is performed or not.
There will be further explanations during the gameplay.
(Unfortunately the explanations during the game are in italians, i will translate it as soon as is possible)

Thanks for all, and enjoy!
(tell me if you will encounter some bugs)
