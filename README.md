A base game built in c that responds similar to the fortnite video game. It's a 1vs1 game to be played locally.

## Project Description
At the beginning the players have to choose the game difficulty. When the game start there is a simulation of the launch in the real fortnite and each player has to choose his side on the map for drop.
The game is based on turn, and in each turn the players can do different things (that are described during the game).
In the game there is also the storm :cloud: :zap: :cloud:, like the real Fortnite.

## Final Battle Description
Finally in the final battle to make everything more playable I chose to add an additional feature for try to kill and destroy the opponent's tower floors. 

The two players can then choose to compete with `Chinese morra` and based on the result, the attack of each player is performed or not.

There will be further explanations during the gameplay.
(*Unfortunately the explanations during the game are in italians, i will translate it as soon as is possible* :trollface:)
